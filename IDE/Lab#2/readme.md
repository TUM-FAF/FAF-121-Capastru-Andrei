# Laboratory work #2

IDE used: **Microsoft Visual Studio**. 
Created a WPF application using Visual C#.

Based on Story:
>   It is 4102. Aliens invaded us. Luckily the world has some great engineers and you are one of them! Your'e working on an unbeatable weapon: Simulatron. Simulatron is an exact copy of alien ship but it has a secret: when the alien gets into ship the alien is traped and brought into human prison. Your task is very simple: you have to clone Simulatron's control panel. World depends on you...

As it is a **Alien Ship**, I didn't make the buttons too visible. Aliens know where which button is.

### Mandatory Tasks:
  - Define 3 virtual tasks that you Simulatron is supposed to control
    - Lift
    - Fire
    - Identify
  - Create a GUI application with 5 standard controls (any child window control mentioned in book Windows Programming

### Tasks With Points:
  - Add 3 non-standard controls (2pt)
    - Voice output;
    - Pop-up window
    - Sound Loading
  - Create a custom control (not existent in IDE) (2pt)
  - Make controls to interact. At least 3 interactions (1pt)
  - Add a GUI test (1pt)
  - Set a breakpoint in your application and check variables values at that moment of time (1pt)
  - Create an installable application (1pt)
  - Image animation (fade in, fade out)
  - GIF animation
  - Custom pop-up window

###Conlcusion
During this laboratory work I get a deeper knowledge in WPF and how to use C# for different tasks. Was very enjoyable to see the rising of Simulatron. It is very simple to use already integrated complex libraries(thre are a lot available) to synthetization, timers, animations etc.
